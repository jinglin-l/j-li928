# Personal Website

As I begin my Hack Club journey and start creating more projects, I'd like a portfolio where people can find everything I've made and learn some things about me. 

My website allows people to:
- Look at my projects  
- Read a quick bio about me  
- Get in contact with me  

I made my site using **HTML**, **CSS**, and **JavaScript**. I looked at a lot of examples of personal websites to find a style and format that suited me. I struggled with designing a space that I felt accurately conveyed myself and my brand. I went back and forth between designs a lot. This was also my first time using my own images on a website, so I struggled with getting them to show up properly.

## In the future, I'd like to add some more sections like:

- **Favorites**: things like favorite books, movies, shows, pieces of media, etc.  
- **Blog**: if I ever start one  
- **Resume**
